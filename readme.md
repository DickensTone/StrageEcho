# Echo
Echo come from a demo of Netty's File Transport server.  
Now, it is under casual developing.Because, I'm learning Netty. if you have something interesting about this demo, write it in issues.

This project is under slow develop.I need to learn the knowledge to complete it.
Process:5%. :)
### Introduction
Echo is a file server, that could send file from client to server.Of course, client can get the file from server.

### Plan to use Nacos as config center.

[nacos Official documents ](https://nacos.io/)

## Run it
Soon, you can git clone the project and start the server and client.The more steps will publish by doing working.
